🔑 Wordlist-Based Login Simulator (Python)

This is a simple Python script that simulates a wordlist-based login brute-force attack in a safe, local environment.
It is designed purely for educational purposes to understand password guessing techniques and the importance of strong passwords.



🚀 Features

Simulates login attempts using a predefined wordlist

Stops when the correct password is found

Displays each password attempt in real time

Helps understand brute-force attacks in a controlled environment



🛠 Requirements

Python 3.7+

No external libraries required

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows



🧾 Example Usage
python login_bruteforce_simulator.py




Sample Output:

Trying password: 123456
Trying password: password
Trying password: admin
Trying password: letmein
Trying password: P@ssw0rd123

✅ Password found: P@ssw0rd123


If the password is not in the wordlist:

❌ Password not found in wordlist




⚙️ Configuration

You can change the target username and password:

VALID_USERNAME = "admin"
VALID_PASSWORD = "P@ssw0rd123"


You can extend the wordlist for testing:

wordlist = ["123456", "password", "admin", "letmein", "P@ssw0rd123"]




⚠️ Legal & Ethical Notice

This tool is for educational purposes only.
Do not use it on real websites or accounts without explicit permission.
Unauthorized brute-force attacks are illegal.
