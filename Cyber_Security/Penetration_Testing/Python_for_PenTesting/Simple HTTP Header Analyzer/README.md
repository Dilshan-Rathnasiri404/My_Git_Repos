🌐 HTTP Header Analyzer (Python)

This is a simple Python script that fetches and displays HTTP response headers for a given target domain or URL.
Analyzing headers is an important part of web application pentesting, as they may reveal:

Server technology (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

Frameworks or CMS used

Security headers (or missing ones)



🚀 Features

Fetches HTTP headers from a target website

Works with both http:// and https://

Displays results in a clean format

Useful for reconnaissance and security header analysis

🛠 Requirements

Python 3.7+

requests library (install using pip install requests)

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

Optional:

A target web server (test only on authorized systems)



🧾 Example Usage
python header_analyzer.py


Sample Output:

Enter target domain or URL: example.com

⚙️ Configuration

If you want to check for specific security headers, you can extend the script:

security_headers = ["Strict-Transport-Security", "Content-Security-Policy", "X-Frame-Options"]


And check if they exist in the response. This helps identify missing security controls.



⚠️ Legal & Ethical Notice

Use this tool only on websites you own or have explicit permission to test.
Unauthorized scanning or probing of web servers can be illegal.

📚 Learning Outcome

By using this project, you will:

Learn to use the requests library to interact with HTTP servers

Understand the significance of HTTP response headers

Practice a fundamental step in web reconnaissance during penetration testing
