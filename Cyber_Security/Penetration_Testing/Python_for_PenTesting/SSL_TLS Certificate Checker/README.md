🔐 SSL/TLS Certificate Checker (Python)

This is a simple Python script that fetches and analyzes the SSL/TLS certificate of a given domain.
Checking certificates is a key step in web security auditing, as expired or misconfigured certificates can leave websites vulnerable.


🚀 Features

Retrieves SSL/TLS certificate information from a target domain

Displays:

Issuer of the certificate

Validity period (start and end dates)

Status (valid or expired)

Helps identify weak or expired certificates during security assessments


🛠 Requirements

Python 3.7+

Uses built-in libraries: ssl, socket, datetime

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

Optional:

A target domain with HTTPS enabled


🧾 Example Usage
python ssl_checker.py


Sample Output:

Enter target domain (without https://): example.com

[+] SSL Certificate Info for example.com:

Issuer: DigiCert Inc
Valid From: 2023-01-15 00:00:00
Valid To:   2024-12-15 23:59:59
✅ Certificate is VALID


Or, for an expired certificate:

⚠️ Certificate is EXPIRED!


⚙️ Configuration

The default port is 443 (HTTPS).
If your target uses a non-standard HTTPS port, you can modify the port parameter in the script:

check_ssl_cert("example.com", port=8443)


⚠️ Legal & Ethical Notice

Use this tool only on websites you own or have explicit permission to test.
Unauthorized probing or scanning of servers can be illegal.


📚 Learning Outcome
