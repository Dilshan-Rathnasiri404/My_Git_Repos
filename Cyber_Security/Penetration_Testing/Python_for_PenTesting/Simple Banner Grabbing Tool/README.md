üîé Banner Grabbing Tool (Python)

This is a simple Python script that performs banner grabbing on common network service ports.
Banner grabbing is a basic pentesting and reconnaissance technique used to identify services and their versions running on a target machine.


üöÄ Features

Scans a list of common service ports (FTP, SSH, HTTP, MySQL, etc.)

Connects and attempts to read service banners

Displays banners in a clean output format

Helps in service enumeration during security assessments


üõ† Requirements

Python 3.7+

Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

No external libraries required (uses Python's built-in socket module)

Optional:

A target machine with open services (for testing)

Run inside a virtual lab or authorized testing environment



üßæ Example Usage
python banner_grabber.py



Sample Output:

Enter target IP or domain: 127.0.0.1

[*] Starting banner grabbing...

[+] 127.0.0.1:21 --> 220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
[+] 127.0.0.1:22 --> SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1
[-] Could not grab banner from 127.0.0.1:443 ([Errno 111] Connection refused)




‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the ports to scan by editing this line in banner_grabber.py:

ports = [21, 22, 25, 80, 443, 3306]


Add or remove ports based on your target environment.



‚ö†Ô∏è Legal & Ethical Notice

This tool is for educational and ethical pentesting purposes only.
Do not use it on systems you do not own or do not have permission to test.
Unauthorized scanning can be illegal and may result in legal action.



üìö Learning Outcome

By using this project, you will:

Understand how TCP socket connections work

Learn to extract service banners programmatically

Practice a fundamental reconnaissance step in penetration testing
