🛰 Simple Network Sniffer (Python)

This project is a basic network packet sniffer built using Python’s raw sockets.
It allows you to capture network packets and view their basic details, demonstrating how sniffing tools work under the hood.

🚀 Features

Captures incoming network packets in real time

Displays packet length and source address

Minimal and easy-to-understand code

🛠 Requirements

Python 3.7+

Requires administrator/root privileges to capture packets:

sudo python network_sniffer.py

🧾 Example Usage
sudo python network_sniffer.py


Sample Output:

[*] Listening for network packets... (Press Ctrl+C to stop)
[+] Packet captured from 192.168.1.1 | Length: 60 bytes
[+] Packet captured from 8.8.8.8 | Length: 98 bytes

⚙️ Notes

Works best on Linux or Windows with admin privileges

This is a very basic sniffer – it doesn’t decode packet contents

For advanced packet parsing, use libraries like scapy

⚠️ Legal & Ethical Notice
