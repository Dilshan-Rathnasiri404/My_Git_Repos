🔑 Hash Cracker (Dictionary Attack)

This project demonstrates a dictionary-based hash cracking tool written in Python.
It attempts to match a given hash against a list of candidate passwords and reveals the plaintext password if found.

🚀 Features

Supports MD5 hashing out of the box

Simple and easy to modify for other hashing algorithms

Uses a customizable wordlist

Demonstrates a dictionary attack in a safe environment

🛠 Requirements

Python 3.7+

No external libraries required (uses built-in hashlib)

🧾 Example Usage
python hash_cracker.py

Sample Output:

[+] Password found: admin

If the password isn’t in the wordlist:

[-] Password not found in wordlist.

⚙️ Configuration

Change the target hash in the code:

target_hash = "21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3" # MD5 of "admin"

Extend or edit the wordlist:

wordlist = ["password", "123456", "admin", "letmein", "welcome"]

To use a different hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA256), replace:

hashlib.md5(word.encode()).hexdigest()

with:

hashlib.sha256(word.encode()).hexdigest()

⚠️ Legal & Ethical Notice

This tool is for educational purposes only.
Never use it on real systems or stolen hashes without permission.
Unauthorized password cracking is illegal.
